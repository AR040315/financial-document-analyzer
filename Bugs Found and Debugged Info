## Bugs Identified & Fixes Implemented

### 1. LLM Provider Not Specified
**Issue:**  
LiteLLM was throwing error:  
`LLM Provider NOT provided`

**Fix:**  
Updated model name to use Groq-compatible format and configured base_url correctly:
base_url="https://api.groq.com/openai/v1"
model="groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant"

---

### 2. Token Limit (Rate Limit Exceeded)
**Issue:**  
Groq TPM limit exceeded due to large document prompts.

**Fix:**  
- Reduced prompt size
- Removed unnecessary verbosity
- Controlled structured JSON output

---

### 3. Hallucinated / Fabricated Data
**Issue:**  
Model was generating assumed revenue breakdown and fake metrics.

**Fix:**  
Added strict prompt rules:
- Do NOT fabricate missing data
- Explicitly return "Not Provided"
- Perform calculations only if sufficient data exists

---

### 4. Unstructured Output
**Issue:**  
Output was returning paragraphs instead of structured format.

**Fix:**  
Implemented strict JSON enforcement with defined schema template.

---

### 5. CrewAI Thought-Only Output
**Issue:**  
Model returned: `"Thought: I now can give a great answer"`

**Fix:**  
Refined prompt to force structured JSON and disable reasoning verbosity.

---

### 6. Telemetry Connection Error
**Issue:**  
CrewAI telemetry failing with:
`telemetry.crewai.com getaddrinfo failed`

**Fix:**  
Disabled telemetry to prevent runtime interruption.
